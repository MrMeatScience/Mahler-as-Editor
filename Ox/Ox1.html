        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 4%">
            This study uses primary sources from the Austrian National Library Archive in Vienna to reconstruct Gustav Mahler’s performance of Siegfried Wagner’s opera <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i> at the Hofoper in 1899, and argues that Mahler’s extensive revisions to the score shed light on his aesthetic sensibilities as well as his dramaturgical perspective as an opera conductor.  I encoded score examples in MEI and rendered them using Verovio, so that the reader can interact with the score and view the selected excerpt at different points in its revision history. The version of the thesis presented here is highly abridged for the purposes of this application.

        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 4%">
            On 22 January 1899, the opera <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i> (<i>The Man in a Bear’s Skin</i>) received its premiere at the Königliches Hof- und Nationaltheater München. Its composer was the only son of Richard Wagner, Siegfried. Siegfried Wagner (1869-1930) studied music beginning in 1889 with his father’s notable student, Engelbert Humperdinck, but decided to begin pursuing a career in architecture, studying in Berlin and Karlsruhe. While on a trip to Asia in 1892, Wagner reversed course and chose to take up music professionally, sketching a symphonic poem during the course of the trip, which was ultimately premiered in 1895. From 1896 he began conducting in earnest, becoming an associate conductor at Bayreuth (there his conducting of the Ring Cycle earned him praise from Gustav Mahler). It is in the operatic genre that Siegfried, like his father, produced the majority of his compositions, writing 18 over the course of his life. The first of these was <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i>, Wagner’s Op. 1.

        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 4%">
            The opera’s genesis can be dated to 1895, when Humperdinck’s aborted plan to compose an opera on the Grimm stories “Der Bärenhäuter” and “Des Teufels rußiger Bruder” came to Siegfried’s attention via his sister, who had recently met the older composer. Working from Wilhelm Hertz’s Spielmannsbuch and the two Grimm stories, Siegfried began writing the opera in 1896, on a libretto he had prepared himself from the existing stories, starting with the overture, as he had apparently already conceived many of <i>Bärenhäuter</i>’s themes.  The full score was completed on 6 June 1898. Max Brockhaus in Leipzig acquired the rights to publish the work. The January 1899 Munich premiere was, by some accounts, a great success, and several houses later staged the work.<a id="text1" href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>

            The opera, set just after the 30 Years War, concerns Hans Kraft, a soldier who becomes employed by the devil to stoke the flames in Hell. After losing some of the devil’s souls in a dice game with the Stranger, Hans is cursed to wander the earth with bad hygiene and a bottomless sack of gold unless a woman stays faithful to him for three years. He returns to his hometown and discovers that the mayor (who has three daughters) is in debt to the innkeeper. Hans pays the debt in full and the mayor promises one of his daughters to him. Two of the daughters mock him but Luise pledges to be faithful and takes his ring. Three years pass and the devil releases Hans and gives him three wishes. The Stranger advises Hans to liberate Plassenburg from the Wallensteins, which he does, and finds Luise who has indeed remained faithful.

            The 1899 Viennese production at the Hofoper under Gustav Mahler is the focus of this thesis. Mahler (1860-1911) took over the directorship of the Hofoper in 1897, and began instituting sweeping reforms in an attempt to restore glory to an institution in decline, plagued by lazy musicians and general complacency. Mahler was by his own admission naturally averse to cuts in the works of both the symphonic and operatic repertoires — he gave the first uncut Viennese performances of several of Richard Wagner’s operas, including the complete Ring Cycle and <i>Die Meistersinger</i> — but was unafraid to modify a score where he thought it warranted. His willingness to rework the score applied equally to canonical composers as well as young newcomers to the scene.  Mahler famously made some <i>retuschen</i> (retouchings) to the symphonies of Beethoven and Schumann (of which much has already been written), and made such sweeping cuts in Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony as to dramatically alter the nature of the music.<a id="text2" href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a id="text3" href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>

        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 4%">
            Mahler was even unafraid to arrange pieces of chamber music (such as Beethoven’s Op. 95 quartet) for orchestra. About this project, Mahler told the critic Eduard Hanslick:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="ex1">
            Chamber music by definition is intended for performance in a domestic setting. It is really only enjoyed by the performers. Once it is transferred to the concert hall, the intimacy is lost; but more still is lost: in a large space the four parts are weakened and do not reach the listener with the strength intended by the composer. I give them this strength by reinforcing each part. Don’t we do the same in the orchestral movements of Haydn and in the Mozart overtures? Does this alter the character of those works? Certainly not. The sound volume of a work must be adapted to the dimensions of the hall in which it is to be given. In a small theatre I would give the <i>Nibelungen</i> with a reduced orchestra, just as in an enormous theatre I would reinforce it.<a id="text4" href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>

            This nineteenth-century notion of authentic performance practice seems somewhat alien in today’s HIP-inflected performance scene, in which most would sooner reduce rather than increase the number of players in Haydn or Mozart. Nevertheless, this quotation is a valuable insight into Mahler’s conceptualization of the role of the conductor or performer as an intermediary between the composer and the audience, whose job is to convey the character of a piece of music, not to deliver the score exactly as printed in every circumstance. In order to heighten the impact of a piece and maintain a certain abstract integrity to the original, Mahler would make modifications. Mahler is demonstrating what Lydia Goehr would call an “open-concept” of the work, a notion that has roots in Nietszche and Wittgenstein's writings.<a id="text5" href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>Incidentally, Mahler’s Beethoven arrangement also dates to 1899, the same year as the Viennese premiere of <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i>.

            Thanks to detailed notes kept by the players inside the covers of the parts, it is possible to speak with precision about the orchestral rehearsal schedule for the Viennese production of the opera.<a id="text13" href="#footnote13"><sup>6</sup></a> According to a violinist, there were twelve rehearsals for the players, beginning on 27 February, exactly a month before the opening performance. Mahler led this rehearsal, which lasted 2 hours (from 10 AM to noon, according to our violinist). There were two subsequent “Correcturproben” before the first of two Sitzproben on 2 March (the second followed the next day). The first Ensembleprobe occurred on 13 March, and five more took place between that date and the last rehearsal, a “Generalprobe,” on 23 March.<a id="text14" href="#footnote14"><sup>7</sup></a> In a bit of political maneuvering, Mahler tried to get Hans Richter to conduct the premiere. The outgoing director of the Vienna Philharmonic and conductor of many of Richard Wagner’s Viennese premieres, Richter was soon to depart Vienna for the Hallé Concert Society in Manchester (for which Mahler would be blamed), and he was Siegfried’s godfather. This did not come to pass, and Mahler took flak for depriving Richter of the opportunity of “guiding Richard Wagner’s son’s first steps in the theatre.”<a id="text15" href="#footnote15"><sup>8</sup></a>
