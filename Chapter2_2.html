            The seventh scene, which would have concluded the second act in Siegfried’s version, sees Spitz, presumably aggrieved
            after the situation with the sack, goading farmers into attacking Hans, but Luise defuses the situation. Removing this 
            scene makes dramatic sense, as it has strong narrative ties to the eliminated fourth scene and is ultimately a diversion
            from the central plot. Removing the finale of the act required a bit of re-composition, however, and there are two 
            pages added to the end of scene 6 that also contain a few new lines of dialogue. As of yet, no certain authorship for 
            this new material can be determined, but it must have been done at Mahler’s behest. Regardless, this is an excellent 
            example of Mahler’s dramatic sense, choosing to end the act with Luise’s pledge to remain faithful to Hans in his 
            absence instead of an aborted lynching. The innkeeper is determined to be rid of Hans after the episode with the sack 
            in scene 4, and has gathered up the community farmers to lynch him under the assumption that he is in league with the 
            devil, all of which seems contrived to get the chorus of farmers on stage for the finale. Hans and Spitz have an 
            argument, during which the farmers attempt to kill Hans, viewing his bag of gold as evidence of his satanic alliance. 
            Luise, however, intercedes on his behalf and convinces them to leave. Mahler’s alternate finale is much more intimate 
            and emotional in concept. Ending the act by depicting the beginning of Hans’s salvation instead of an unnecessary scene 
            that has no real consequence for the narrative makes much more sense for the opera’s plot. An added benefit of both of 
            these cuts (scenes 4 and 7) is a certain homogenization of tone. The fourth scene itself is little more than a comic 
            interlude, complete with wide-leaping vocal acrobatics for the Innkeeper, and the quasi-comic confrontation between 
            Spitz, his farmer-gang, and Hans in the seventh scene interrupts an otherwise heartfelt episode that contains some of 
            the opera’s more beautiful music (elements of which Mahler incorporated into the recomposed finale).
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            There is enough circumstantial evidence to speculate about when Mahler made these changes during the course of 
            preparation for the production. Scene 7 is left intact in the vocal score, and Mahler even went so far as to mark in 
            all of his cues for the singers, insert rehearsal numbers, and indicate his ideas about stressed syllables. He must 
            have decided to abandon scene 7 very early in rehearsals, however, because the orchestral score has been left almost 
            entirely unedited. There are just a few markings, including a fermata, a handful of cues, a few expressive marks, and 
            most interestingly, one of the only instances of reorchestration in the entire opera, although it was evidently not 
            retained. Mahler writes “Ob Fag” (“oboes/bassoons”) with a rhythm and unstaved pitches next to it, suggesting he had an 
            idea, but no such corrections appeared in the players’ parts (and in any case the scene went unperformed). However, it 
            is valuable since it reveals that Mahler was dissatisfied with the music in this scene, which, when coupled with its 
            weak dramaturgy, made it an obvious early choice for the chopping block. Mahler also prepared the vocal score of the 
            brief scene 4 for rehearsal with the same sorts of indications as found in scene 7. Judging by the conductor’s score, 
            the fourth scene probably survived longer into the rehearsal process than the seventh did, as the score of the fourth 
            scene is marked up to a noticeably greater degree with cues and reminders of metrical changes.

            <u>Structural Changes: Act III</u>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Mahler revised the third act finale and the music leading up to it so extensively as to fundamentally change the scene,
            and did so in the vocal score, which represents the first stage of his editing process. Mahler deleted several lines of
            dialogue by scratching them out with a pencil and changed others with the result of increased clarity of plot. The first
            of these major cuts begins in the fourth bar of rehearsal 113, in the finale of the third act (referenced in the table 
            of cuts as III.5.1). The cut material is another encounter between Hans and the now borderline hysterical innkeeper 
            about the attempted theft of Hans’ bag. This cut is logical since the subplot was eliminated in Act II, as described 
            above.

            remove all choral material from the scene. Thirteen bars elapse, with minor changes made to Hans’ text and rhythm on 
            page 175, before the next cut (III.5.3), which removes a sizable portion of Luise’s dialogue, but nothing that moves 
            the plot forward. Luise’s vocal part is rhythmically altered, but strangely the text is not. The next cut (III.5.4)

            This next cut (III.5.4), beginning at the end of the page in Image V and lasting 9 bars, removes a portion of 
            Luise’s text that contains religious content (a prayer to the angels), a passage which Cosima considered “the heart of
            the work.”<a id="t25" href="#fn25"><sup>25</sup></a> The subsequent cut (III.5.5), which begins at the end of page 176
            and removes some seven pages of material, also excises lines with allusions to angels and God. After this final cut, the
            bass and cello line is recomposed to be simpler, but the concluding pages play out as Siegfried originally wrote them. 
            As previously noted, Mahler’s removal of all of the opera’s religious content was the change that incensed the Wagners 
            most. According to Cosima, Siegfried had lobbied to retain “the most important passage.” It must have been the opera’s 
            conclusion, as no other religious scenes remain.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Though some of the cuts in the third act finale can be traced to the earliest stages of Mahler’s interaction with the 
            vocal score, the targeted trimming of sacred components does not seem to have been the motivation. Why Mahler decided 
            to remove all of it is less clear. Considering his overall push for concision and consistency in the opera, it is 
            possible that he chose to eliminate the prayers because piety had not been a thread in the narrative. These aesthetic 
            ideals may not necessarily be what comes to mind when considering Mahler’s own symphonies, given their length and 
            episodic, rapidly shifting forms, but it is worth noting that they are also highly motivic, with a handful of germinal 
            ideas generating much of the music. Many of those motives have been ascribed programmatic meaning by listeners (the 
            descending second of the Ninth Symphony as “Lebwohl,” for instance), resulting in a framing of his works in dramatic 
            terms, despite Mahler’s refusal to provide programs and relatively strong stance on the matter.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Certain musical moments in his symphonies were characterized very explicitly (albeit unofficially) in relation to 
            something extramusical. Bruno Walter relates Mahler’s description of an early part of the Third Symphony as portraying 
            the granite cliffs surrounding the Attersee, where the work was composed.<a id="t26" href="#fn26"><sup>26</sup></a>
            The famous third movement funeral march of the First Symphony is well-known as depicting the woodcut of the hunter’s 
            funeral procession by Moritz von Schwind. The opening tenorhorn solo of the Seventh Symphony was described by Mahler as 
            “nature calling like a stag.”<a id="t27" href="#fn27"><sup>27</sup></a> Beyond mere associations, though, Mahler’s First,
            Second, and Third Symphonies were each initially given programs that the composer later retracted. Though it does not
            have a “program” in a literal sense, Mahler’s Sixth Symphony operates similarly; there are themes assigned to 
            individuals (Alma, for instance) and the famous hammer-blows in the final movement are the blows which fell the hero. 
            In the Eighth Symphony’s second part, Mahler actually sets the final scene of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>, and his early 
            cantata <i>Das Klagende Lied</i> is almost an unstaged opera. This is not to ascribe programs to Mahler’s symphonies, 
            as this was something he vehemently rejected. Nevertheless his lengthy compositions, filled with recurring motives, 
            recognizable topics (cowbells, elements of vernacular music, hammer blows) and a sense of having journeyed somewhere, 
            invite audiences to listen as if it were program music, superimposing their own programs, or programs they have stumbled
            across (the Seventh as a gradual progression from night to day, for instance) onto Mahler’s abstract works.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
        When making musical decisions, Mahler spoke more about the effect those choices would have on an audience’s emotions than in
        technical musical terms, revealing some of the same underlying concerns displayed in his editing – namely, that quality and
        intensity of affect are of the utmost importance. As an example, the October 1900 performance of the Second Symphony in 
        Munich included less than half the string players Mahler desired. He claimed, “when [I have the forces I want], 
        people will be amazed to see how much it magnifies the effect!”<a id="t28" href="#fn28"><sup>28</sup></a> Outside of his 
        work conducting his own music, things were little different. Though his alterations to the orchestration of 
        <i>Bärenhäuter</i> are limited, their presence reminds us that Mahler was keenly aware of orchestral timbre as a vehicle for
        affect (a point agreed upon by both his supporters and detractors in Vienna, to their own ends). In reducing the scope of 
        Siegfried’s opera by removing secondary elements, Mahler was able to concentrate it in the process, staying true to his 
        aesthetic principles by increasing unity and the intensity of affect.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="ex1">
            <u>Local Changes</u>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            The same aesthetic ideals are evident in localized, minute changes as well, as explored below in an excerpt from Act I,
            scene 4. In the vocal score, Mahler indicated early versions of some cuts that would become more refined in the final 
            score. The first of these is made one measure before rehearsal 90 and runs until one measure after rehearsal 93 
            (nineteen measures). This scene depicts Hans playing dice with the Stranger for possession of the devil’s souls that 
            Hans has been instructed to guard. The Stranger continually outplays Hans, and each time they increase the stakes. 
            Mahler apparently felt that this was going on too long and trimmed the penultimate game and the corresponding dialogue 
            so that they immediately raise the wager to all of the souls. The precise placement of the cut was probably determined 
            by the text; as it stands in the vocal score, Mahler cuts from “oder hätte ich zu wählen” to “so gält es nun alle Seelen,
            ” surgically removing music in such a way that it required no recomposition, either of text or music, and it even rhymes
            the same word with “wählen” as Siegfried does in his original version. The resultant of this cut is a bit leaner 
            dramatically, and faster paced.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            The final draft of this moment in the full score, however, has a substantially more complex reworking. 
            Starting a bar before rehearsal 89 and lasting for three pages, the original score has new pages pasted over it, 
            in an unknown copyist’s hand. The last of these added pages contains the “oder hätte ich zu wählen” line noted above, 
            but now the cut removes that line from Mahler’s added pages. The “de” end of the cut (“vi-de”) arrives just before an 
            identical line on the next page in the original engraved score, with Mahler’s old cut from the vocal score (described in
            the preceding paragraph) removed: the wager is again 500 souls, as in Siegfried’s unaltered libretto, instead of 
            jumping immediately to all of them. Evidently Mahler decided that his initial impulse didn’t work, and so he reversed 
            his decision. A few bars later there is another cut (I.4.4) just after the dice roll for the 500 souls, which removes 
            most of the dialogue that does not directly advance the plot, and picks up again just before the next dice roll, which 
            is for all the souls.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Seeing the relatively complicated evolution of this single minor cut reveals the depth of thought and effort that Mahler
            was lavishing on this score. Despite producing no mature theatrical works himself, his many years as an opera director 
            had made him a man of the theatre. He perceived the drama to be impeded by superfluous dialogue between games, and 
            tested different ways of removing the offending material before settling on one that makes the resultant dramaturgy more
            concise and effective.

            <b>Part III: Mahler the Editor — Observations and Deductions</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            As we have seen, Mahler had a somewhat complex view on editing music. Neither his own scores nor those of other 
            composers were above reproach, and he made changes to both where he thought them warranted. Some of Mahler’s 
            alterations were meant to be permanent revisions to the score, while others were temporary, determined by immediate 
            context. His process was highly dependent on the particular circumstances of a performance, down to the specific venue 
            in some instances. Mahler’s bold decisions regarding symphonic repertoire are well documented. He removed some chords 
            in the trombone parts during rehearsals for a performance of his Second Symphony in 1907, and defended his choice by 
            saying, “Hail to the conductor who in the future will change my scores according to the acoustics of the concert hall.” 
            Given this attention to bespoke individual performances, it isn’t terribly surprising that his protégé and assistant 
            Otto Klemperer later claimed that Mahler viewed such edits as personal changes only, not to be repeated by others 
            without arriving at the same alterations independently. Klemperer believed that the publication of Mahler’s Schumann 
            symphony edits would have greatly upset him, but this has not stopped conductors from performing them.<a id="t29" href="#fn29"><sup>29</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Mahler took such editing very seriously throughout his conducting career. He expanded that aspect of his work 
            dramatically during his season leading the subscription concerts in Hamburg in 1894 and 1895, during which time he 
            ceased marking only his scores and began marking the complete set of orchestral parts as well. This was a task he 
            entrusted to no one else, refusing assistance from his colleagues and taking stacks of music home with him to mark in 
            the evenings, taking great pains to ensure that nothing was overlooked by his players.<a id="t30" href="#fn30"><sup>30</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Many of the changes he made in repertory works he viewed as undoing the damage done by other conductors’ 
            interpretations in the past, such as the changes in dynamics made in the Schumann and Beethoven symphonies. Mahler 
            judged the worship of tradition antithetical to the art of music, claiming that the stagnant repertoire, lack of 
            innovation, and mediocre and predictable performances were “Schlamperei” (translated loosely, “sloppy”). Thus he set 
            about delivering radically new interpretations of old favorites, which often became a point of contention with 
            complacent musicians. Mahler was aware that some of his revisions would meet with automatic hostility from the 
            antisemitic and deeply conservative audience, and so he explained some of his alterations (for the Beethoven symphonies,
            for example) in the program notes provided at the concert.<a id="t31" href="#fn31"><sup>31</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            In the operatic genre, however, Mahler’s changes are somewhat harder to understand. There is no video documentation to 
            reveal whether changes in the score are in any way related to the singers or stage production, for example. Here 
            Mahler’s notions of authenticity were sometimes subjugated in the service of greater dramatic effect. Mahler’s 
            reorchestrations in Beethoven’s <i>Fidelio</i>, made for a 1908 production at the Metropolitan Opera, were judged by 
            reviewers to have increased the emotional and dramatic impact, especially in the introduction to the second act.<a id="t32" href="#fn32"><sup>32</sup></a>
            In another instance, Mahler removed the overture to one of Haydn’s operas and replaced it with a Haydn “symphony” 
            (which specific one, or whether it was complete, is not clear), a change which was very well received by Eduard 
            Hanslick.<a id="t33" href="#fn33"><sup>33</sup></a> Nonetheless, he was strongly opposed to making alterations where he
            thought them unnecessary, as mentioned earlier with regard to his Viennese performances of many of Richard Wagner’s 
            operas. His judgement alone was the metric.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            In addition to the standard operatic fare of the late nineteenth century, Mahler introduced quite a few new works to the
            Hofoper’s repertoire during his 10-year post there, and some of these works were subject to even greater modification 
            than the music mentioned previously. In fact, the very first new work Mahler gave in Vienna, in the fall of 1897, was 
            Bedřich Smetana’s <i>Dalibor</i>. He partially reorchestrated it and gave it an entirely new finale, suggesting that he found 
            Smetana’s original ending dramatically unsuccessful.<a id="t34" href="#fn34"><sup>34</sup></a> Nevertheless, he 
            resisted performing works he thought were truly subpar, even when they were by popular composers. His initial refusal to
            stage Hugo Wolf’s <i>Der Corregidor</i> in 1897 was the end of their relationship; days later Wolf had a psychological 
            breakdown that resulted in his institutionalization.<a id="t35" href="#fn35"><sup>35</sup></a> The opera administration
            also attempted to force Mahler to program certain works. Prince and Obersthofmeister Liechtenstein’s attempt to get an 
            opera by Count Géza Zichy staged was doomed by Mahler’s refusal to cooperate despite the potential danger to his career.
            He declared that he was only beholden to the Emperor, and if he were forced to perform the opera, the posters would have
            to state, “By Royal Command.” This ended Liechtenstein’s crusade.<a id="t36" href="#fn36"><sup>36</sup></a> 
            Interestingly, Klemperer indicates that Count Zichy also tried to get Mahler to stage his opera while he was the 
            conductor in Budapest, which accelerated Mahler’s relocation to Hamburg. <a id="t37" href="#fn37"><sup>37</sup></a>
            Siegfried Wagner’s <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i>, however, was one work that he was politically unable to reject despite his 
            low opinion of it (he did not hesitate to decline Siegfried’s subsequent attempts in the genre, however).<a id="t38" href="#fn38"><sup>38</sup></a>
            Though hotly anticipated as the debut of Richard Wagner’s son, Viennese audiences quickly reached similar conclusions,
            and a joke circulated that “the Emperor wants to ennoble Siegfried Wagner because he prefers <i>Siegfried</i> von Wagner to 
            Siegfried Wagner.”<a id="t39" href="#fn39"><sup>39</sup></a> So it came to be staged in Mahler’s highly modified version. 
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            The precise reasons for each of Mahler’s alterations are naturally impossible to divine with certainty, but with 
            knowledge of Mahler’s editorial tendencies and artistic concerns, as well as what little he said about the opera, it is
            possible to hazard some reasonably educated guesses. He apparently found the first act fairly effective but took great 
            issue with the remainder of the work, claiming that it hardly seemed to have been composed by the same man.<a id="t40" href="#fn40"><sup>40</sup></a>
            As  noted, the largest changes he made included striking the fourth and seventh scenes of the second act wholesale, 
            which results in a more cohesive dramatic unity. These scenes about Hans’ conflict with a secondary character are 
            ultimately irrelevant to the dramatic through-line of the work, which is Hans’ eventual redemption by Luise through the 
            power of love and fidelity (a very Wagnerian theme). Though Mahler did not write any operas, making direct comparison 
            impossible, his symphonic compositions have a similar unity and cohesion of theme. This is especially true in the later
            works like the Ninth Symphony and <i>Das Lied von der Erde</i>, both of which are highly unified by recurring motives, such as
            the turn and the descending major second in the Ninth.<a id="t41" href="#fn41"><sup>41</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            The smaller modifications to the Wagner score are predominantly in the form of short cuts and changes to the vocal 
            parts. These also exemplify Mahler’s push for concision and clarity, as he often made changes to spell out plot 
            developments for the audience, or to trim scenes that had overstayed their welcome. This motivation is already 
            well-documented by David Pickett as the root of Mahler’s cuts in the symphonic works of Bruckner and Schubert, which 
            often had repetitious phrases eliminated, though always in such a way that the seams were not audible. <a id="t42" href="#fn42"><sup>42</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Mahler’s operatic revisions seem to generally fall into one or both of two categories: those that improve the work’s 
            focus, and those that heighten dramatic impact. In the case of <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i>, unnecessary scenes for secondary 
            characters and excessive repetition dilute dramatic focus, and the fault lay primarily with the composer’s poorly-edited
            libretto rather than the score itself. An early example of the latter is in Act I, scene 1 (cut I.1.1), where he cut 
            measures 30-39 of the scene. <a id="t43" href="#fn43"><sup>43</sup></a> Soldiers are returning home to the town after 
            fighting in the 30 Years’ War, and the villagers are gathering excitedly to receive them. These nine excised bars 
            consist of exclamations of excitement from the townsfolk (the likes of which we’ve already heard in the previous 
            phrases), and the music is likewise made of the same martial material that immediately precedes it and is of no 
            particular interest. These factors make those nine bars superfluous and therefore prime candidates for removal.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Another instance of a minor change that enhanced dramatic focus by heightening the impact for the audience occurs in 
            Act II, Scene 1. In measures 56 and 57 of that scene, Mahler adds dialogue (with new music) for Anna 
            (“Mannsbilder ihr seid zu feig. Ich selbst will seh’n wer vor die Tür steht.”). Immediately after Anna delivers these 
            lines, Mahler adds a fermata and writes in “aufschrei.”<a id="t44" href="#fn44"><sup>44</sup></a> The sudden silence in 
            the orchestra broken by the scream must have been startling and certainly makes for a markedly more dramatic scene than
            the original version Siegfried wrote, but without massive deviation from the letter of the score.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Interestingly, Mahler made very few changes to the dynamics and orchestration of Siegfried’s opera, suggesting that he 
            found the instrumental balances in the work to be at least sufficient. In some cases, Mahler modified the instrumental 
            parts for dramatic reasons. In one instance in the first scene of Act 1 (beginning at rehearsal 4), Mahler adds 
            crescendi in the strings leading up to the end of a phrase, which is followed by a sparser texture, producing a more 
            dramatic climax than Siegfried’s unadulterated version. <a id="t45" href="#fn45"><sup>45</sup></a>
