            The interactive score examples used in this thesis were encoded using MEI. MEI, or “Music Encoding Initiative,” is 
            an encoding format that is designed to make music machine-readable. It is written according to the MEI schema, “a core
            set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents expressed as an 
            eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema.”<a id="t46" href="#fn46"><sup>46</sup></a>

            MEI, in and of itself is simply code, as seen above. In order to express the MEI as a graphical score like traditional
            printed music, it must be rendered in Verovio. Verovio is a music notation engraving library built in C++, developed by
            the Swiss RISM office, which can engrave MEI scores into SVG (for display) or MIDI (for playback) files. One reason that
            it is particularly well-suited for this task is that it very closely mimics MEI’s internal structure, allowing the user
            to directly reference elements in an MEI file.<a id="t47" href="#fn47"><sup>47</sup></a> It is also easily implementable
            in webpages, such as this one. There are two ways to do this: the app and the Javascript toolkit. The former is more 
            user-friendly, with a GUI complete with built-in buttons for the navigation and zoom functions, but because it 
            currently lacks compatibility with MEI’s editorial markup capabilities, the toolkit has been used here. The navigation 
            and zoom can be coded in the HTML, as they have been for this thesis, allowing access to the full gamut of Verovio’s 
            capabilities. To express information found in MEI’s critical apparatus, elements can be targeted using an xPath query 
            and highlighted however desired. The website itself was written using basic HTML and CSS, and hosted on GitHub along 
            with all of the required files (MEI, images, etc.).

        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Verovio has the capacity to play examples encoded in MEI through MIDI, which represents a major step forward in the usual
            model of visual-only score examples. I implemented audio capability (with technical assistance from Dylan Folsom and 
            Anna Jandura-Cessna) through the toolkit in much the same way as the features described above, although it needs to run
            on a web server in order to work. Despite the limitations of the player, which interprets certain markings incorrectly 
            and is generally buggy, it is particularly useful in the case of this thesis, because it allows the reader to both hear 
            and see the differences between the two versions of the score. Further focused development of this technology could 
            quickly correct its current shortcomings.

            The potential pedagogical use cases for this technology are limitless. Though it is used here for a specific 
            philological purpose, other projects, such as Unlocking Musicology’s Lohengrin TimeMachine Digital Companion, created 
            by the Oxford e-Research Centre, use it to a more general end. In that case, it illustrates the appearances of a 
            particular leitmotif and its changes over the course of an opera, accompanied by an essay by musicologist Laurence 
            Dreyfus.<a id="t48" href="#fn48"><sup>48</sup></a>

            <b>Conclusions</b>
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            Examining Mahler’s work outside of his own compositions can offer an illuminating insight into his aesthetics. After 
            all, we can learn as much about his sensibilities from seeing what he didn’t like and how he attempted to improve it as 
            we can by examining his original work. The numerous flaws Mahler perceived in <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i> and the large 
            amount of surviving material for the opera make it an excellent case study for this kind of inquiry. That Mahler was 
            either naturally or through experience a man of the theatre is undeniable in light of the changes made to 
            <i>Bärenhäuter</i>. There is a concerted effort to increase the dramatic impact throughout, manifested not only in the 
            minutiae of individual scenes but in the large-scale narrative arc of the entire opera. Other modifications to the 
            score are practical in nature, helping to convey an aspect of the drama to the audience, as the added dialogue in the 
            third scene of the second act does. Still other changes distill the story to its essence. The removal of trivial 
            subplots is one obvious example of this sort made in <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="ex1" style="text-indent: 3em">
            The use of MEI and Verovio to illustrate these musicological points about Mahler’s practices represents an exciting 
            step forward in the integration of 21st-century digital technologies with research in the discipline. Through the 
            hard work of the MEI community and individuals like Dr. Laurent Pugin at Verovio, these technologies are constantly 
            improving and offering ever-more utility to the researcher looking to explore new questions. I see the use of 
            interactive score examples of the sort employed in this thesis as an improvement over the traditional static model 
            because of the ability to play back the audio samples from the web browser and to dynamically switch between 
            readings of the score. Future research on the topic of this thesis might explore the creation of a digital edition 
            (encoded in MEI) of Mahler’s version of <i>Der Bärenhäuter</i>, allowing for a complete appraisal of the original work 
            as juxtaposed with the 1899 Hofoper production.
